👋 Hi, I’m Kent Gomez  
👀 I’m interested in supporting busy professionals and entrepreneurs by streamlining administrative tasks, improving workflow efficiency, and keeping things organized behind the scenes.  
🌱 I’m currently learning new productivity tools, automation strategies, and advanced CRM techniques to better support remote teams and executives.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtual assistant roles, admin support projects, and productivity-focused systems for businesses.
